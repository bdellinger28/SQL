#This data analytics project utilizes a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store.
#It included 12 tables to provide data on artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#I answered the following requests using SQL:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.invoiceid,invoices.billingcountry 
FROM chinook.invoices
JOIN chinook.customers on invoices.customerid=customers.customerid
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent%';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT employees.LastName, employees.Firstname, invoices.invoiceId
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.employeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT invoices.total, customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.country, employees.LastName, employees.Firstname
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.employeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT * FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.name,invoice_items.invoiceid
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.invoice_items 
ON tracks.trackid=invoice_items.trackid; 

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.name AS track_name,artists.name AS artist, invoice_items.invoiceid
FROM chinook.invoice_items 
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks
ON tracks.trackid=invoice_items.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums
ON albums.AlbumID=tracks.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists 
ON artists.ArtistID=albums.ArtistID; 

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tracks.name AS 'Track Name', albums.title AS 'Album', media_types.name AS 'Media Type', genres.name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks
JOIN chinook.albums
ON tracks.albumid=albums.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types
ON media_types.mediatypeid=tracks.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres
ON genres.genreid=tracks.genreid; 

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.total),2) AS 'Total Agent Sales'
FROM chinook.employees
JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.employeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent%'
GROUP BY employees.employeeid;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, ROUND(SUM(invoices.total),2) AS 'Total Agent Sales'

GROUP BY employees.employeeid 
ORDER BY 'Total Agent Sales' DESC
