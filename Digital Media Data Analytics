#This data analytics project utilizes a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store.
#It included 12 tables to provide data on artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#I answered the following requests using SQL:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
